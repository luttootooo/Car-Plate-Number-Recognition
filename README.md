# Car-Plate-Number-Recognition

<br> This project was my team's final project for the Digital Image Processing course. It aimed to build a model that can recognize the number/character on the car plate. The dataset was taken from Kaggle. Our project used mixed techniques, like transfer learning and the OCR concept, to solve the problem. I was in charge of preparing the dataset by selecting the proper images from around 500 images and performing some DIP algorithms to increase image quality, like convolution for sharpening, before passing them to the next steps, which are localization, segmentation, and last, OCR. The model failed to recognize some of the car plates due to the number of the dataset used.
